# DiscordBotArmy
Controls a bunch of Discord bots to swarm a single user whenever they join a voice channel

## Setup
Just hit that `npm install` and fill in the necessary information in config.json.
Then once you've started the program and the bots have logged in, use the `init` command to signal to the bots that all their allies have shown up and are ready to swarm their target.
